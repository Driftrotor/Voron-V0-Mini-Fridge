# Voron V0 Mini Fridge
 
 $${\color{RED}VORON \space \color{black}V0 \space \color{black}Mini \space \color{black}Fridge \space \color{black}Skirt!}$$




This MOD is made to bring the skirts and V0 Display forward to keep that Voron Look we so Love.

It comes with a few options too, Like Front (left and right) two piece skirt with integrated display mount, regular front side skirts and display mount or a one piece headless skirt.



 > [!NOTE]
> Most of the printed parts are standard V0.2r1's - The parts needed are only the front Skirts and Feet if you have already updated to the R1 version.
